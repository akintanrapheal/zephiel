# Catalog import

Imports the full product catalog (products + multi-attribute variants + images) from the legacy
WooCommerce site into the in-house DB.

## Pipeline

1. **Extract** `catalog.json` from a WordPress backup (All-in-One WP Migration `.wpress`).
   - The `.wpress` contains a `database.sql` MySQL dump (table prefix `SERVMASK_PREFIX_`).
   - `extract_catalog.py` parses `wp_posts` / `wp_postmeta` / `wp_terms*` and writes a structured
     `catalog.json`: each product with `sku`, `title`, `description`, `categories`, `images`
     (live `sterlinglams.com` URLs), and `variants[]` (each with its `attrs`, e.g. `{color, size}`).
   - Point the `DB` path in the script at the extracted `database.sql`, then `python extract_catalog.py`.

2. **Import** into the app DB (two modes):

   ```
   dotnet run -- import-catalog "tools/catalog-import/catalog.json"            # WIPE + import
   dotnet run -- import-catalog "tools/catalog-import/catalog.json" --upsert   # production-safe
   ```

   - **Default (wipe)** — `DELETE FROM Products` (cascades to variants/images/inventory **and any
     order line items**), then inserts the catalog fresh. Use only for **first-time / dev seeding**;
     it destroys order history.
   - **`--upsert` (production-safe)** — matches incoming products to existing ones by `ExternalCode`
     (`WC-{sku}`): **updates** matches in place (keeps the product ID so `OrderItems` stay linked;
     refreshes scalars + images; leaves variants intact since deleting an ordered variant is blocked
     by FK), **inserts** new products, and **deactivates** (never deletes) `WC-*` products missing from
     the file. Safe to run against the live DB to refresh the catalog.

   Both modes **skip uncategorized products** and import **stock as zero** (set per-branch quantities
   afterwards in admin/Inventory). Implemented by `Services/CatalogImportService.cs`.

## Notes
- ~2,021 published products, ~2,644 variants. Variant attributes: Color, Size, Alphabet,
  Measurement, Signs, Combo.
- Images reference live `https://sterlinglams.com/wp-content/uploads/...` URLs (verified resolving).
- `catalog.json` is checked in so the import is reproducible without the 7 GB backup.
