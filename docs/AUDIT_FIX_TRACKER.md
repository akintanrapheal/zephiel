# Audit Fix Tracker

Living checklist of every fix and recommendation from the ongoing audit. We add items as we
audit, then work the **Open** list top-to-bottom. Companion to `docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md` (the
original findings narrative) — IDs like `C1`/`H6` refer to that report.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-16 (FX-71 OP-12: production no longer auto-migrates on startup — fail-fast on pending migrations unless `Database:AutoMigrate=true`; migrations are a gated deploy step)

### Email customizer (FX-67)
New **Settings → Emails** group (no separate admin screen — uses the existing settings page):
**branding** (`email.from_name`, `email.reply_to`, `email.header_color` colour-picker, `email.footer_text`;
logo via `general.logo_url` when an absolute URL is resolvable) applied to the shared `Wrap` shell + the
From/Reply-To line in `EmailService`; and **per-email subject + intro** for order confirmation, password
reset, email confirmation, back-in-stock and abandoned-cart (defaults match the previous hardcoded text, so
nothing changes until edited). Structure/links stay code-controlled (no template engine / merge variables —
deliberate, to avoid an admin breaking a critical email). Verified (DB + pickup folder): setting a custom
header colour / sender / footer rendered in the next email (`#bb0000`, "CUSTOM BRAND", custom footer); the
Emails tab renders all fields incl. a native colour input.

### Email pickup folder (FX-65)
`SmtpEmailService` previously **no-op'd** when SMTP was unconfigured, so none of the email features
(order confirmation, password reset, email confirmation, low-stock, fulfilment alert, back-in-stock)
could be seen or verified before SMTP is wired. Now, when SMTP isn't configured, it writes the fully
rendered branded `.html` to a **pickup folder** (`App_Data/sent-emails`, gitignored) and returns
success — in **Development only** (or when `Email:PickupDirectory` is set); Production with no SMTP
still safely skips. Verified: on startup the low-stock alert wrote a 39 KB branded email
("Low stock alert — 100 product(s)") to the folder. This makes the whole email suite demonstrable
now; real delivery still needs SMTP creds in `Email:*`.

> ~~Minor cruft: `StoreInventories.LastSyncedAt`~~ — correction: it's **not** dead. `StockService.ApplyAsync`
> stamps it on every stock change and the admin inventory VM reads it (a real "last updated" timestamp);
> only the ERPNext-era *name* was legacy. **FX-70:** renamed the column/property `LastSyncedAt` → `UpdatedAt`
> (RenameColumn migration, data preserved) across model/service/controllers/VM/seed/imports.

### Loyalty reversal on refund (FX-62)
Closes the gap flagged after FX-44/FX-59: a fully-refunded order now reverses loyalty.
`LoyaltyService.ReverseForOrderAsync` (called from `OrdersController.RefundOrder` when the
refund is full) claws back the points **earned** on the order and returns the points
**redeemed**, balance clamped ≥0; idempotent via new `Order.LoyaltyReversedAt` (migration
`OrderLoyaltyReversedAt`). Verified (DB + admin refund): order earned 95 / redeemed 500 →
after full refund the balance returned to the original 500, with `-95 reversed` / `+500
returned` ledger rows and status Refunded. **Partial refunds don't reverse loyalty** (only
full) — noted as acceptable for now. **POS refunds now reverse too (FX-63):** `TillController.RefundProcess` computes full-refund the same way and calls `ReverseForOrderAsync`, clawing back points the attached customer earned on a fully-refunded POS sale (verified: earned 60 → balance 0 after full POS refund, `-60 reversed` ledger row).

### Dead-settings audit (FX-56)
Audited every `SiteSettings` key for a consumer. Wired the rest of the dead ones:
- `homepage.show_featured` (now toggles the Featured section), `homepage.featured_heading` (was hardcoded "Featured Pieces"), `homepage.store_banner_text` (was hardcoded) — Views/Home/Index.cshtml.
- `general.contact_email` + `general.contact_phone` (Contact page hardcoded `hello@…`/`+2348000000000`) — Views/Home/Contact.cshtml.
- Verified each renders custom values; the show-featured toggle hides the section. (`home.feature.b1/b2.*` looked dead in a literal grep but are read via dynamic keys `$"home.feature.{b}.image"` — already wired.)

**Built to back a dead toggle (FX-57):**
- `notifications.low_stock` — ✅ **DONE**: added `LowStockAlertService` (BackgroundService, 6-hour sweep + startup run, mirrors `FulfilmentRetryService`). When the toggle is on it emails `notifications.admin_email` a once-a-day digest of products at/below their low-stock threshold (day-level dedupe). Verified: toggle on → startup sweep computed 100 low products and attempted the send (logged "NOT sent" since dev SMTP is off — sends for real with SMTP configured); toggle off → no attempt.

**Still dead — bigger than wiring (flagged):**
- `store.currency_symbol` — prices hardcode `₦` everywhere (`FormattedPrice => $"₦{…}"`); honoring it means threading the symbol through all price formatting (large/risky). Default is "N" anyway.
- ~~Contact page hardcodes the 3 stores + hours~~ ✅ **DONE (FX-58)**: Contact page now pulls active stores from the DB (like the footer) and reads WhatsApp from `general.whatsapp_number` (was a hardcoded `wa.me/2348000000000`). Verified: shows the 3 DB stores with DB hours; WhatsApp hidden when unset.

### This session (inventory + DB)
| ID | Item | Location |
|----|------|----------|
| FX-18 | Scan box empty-Enter no longer reloads (preserves unsaved grid edits) | Areas/Inventory/Views/Stock/Index.cshtml, Stocktake/Index.cshtml |
| FX-19 | DB integrity migration: 13 indexes + 4 unique (RefundNumber, TransferNumber, Product/Variant Barcode) + 12 CHECK constraints | Migrations/…_DatabaseIntegrityHardening.cs (applied to dev ✅) |
| FX-22 | Neutralized `StoreInventoryConcurrencyToken` migration `Up()`/`Down()` to no-ops (`AddColumn("xmin")` conflicts with the Postgres system column) — unblocks FX-6 & FX-19 deploy | Migrations/…_StoreInventoryConcurrencyToken.cs |
| FX-23 | Admin image upload was gated on a phantom "Upload" section (not in `AdminSections.All`) → only full Admins could upload; re-gated on its sole caller's section ("Settings") | Areas/Admin/Controllers/UploadController.cs |
| FX-24 | POS discount reason/preset CRUD (5 mutations) had **no audit trail** — added `LogAsync` to all five | Areas/Admin/Controllers/PosController.cs |
| FX-25 | Customer order detail never showed the `TrackingNumber` (admin captured it, customer couldn't see it — "shipped, on its way" with no number); now surfaced in the Fulfillment card | Views/Account/OrderDetail.cshtml |
| FX-26 | Merchandising: new `IMerchandisingService` (best sellers / trending / new arrivals / recently-viewed) + cookie-based recently-viewed; **Best Sellers, Trending Now, Recently Viewed** rows added to the home page (reusable `_ProductCardRow` partial). No migration. | Services/MerchandisingService.cs, Infrastructure/RecentlyViewed.cs, Controllers/HomeController.cs + ProductsController.cs, Views/Shared/_ProductCardRow.cshtml, Views/Home/Index.cshtml |
| FX-27 | SEO: added **WebSite + SearchAction** JSON-LD sitewide (enables Google sitelinks search box) | Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml |
| FX-28 | SEO: **image sitemap** — sitemap now emits `<image:image>` for every product (993 images exposed to image search) | Controllers/SeoController.cs |
| FX-29 | Perf: product listing query → **SQL projection** (dropped 4 `Include`s that caused a cartesian JOIN blow-up + over-fetch on the busiest page); TTFB ~20–40ms with ~1k products | Controllers/ProductsController.cs |
| FX-30 | Perf (LCP): hero image now `loading="eager" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async"` so the largest paint isn't deprioritized | Views/Home/Index.cshtml |
| FX-31 | **Stored XSS** in admin delete-confirm handlers — product/store name was interpolated into inline JS with only `'`-escaping; crafted/imported names could break out and run in an Admin session. Moved name to a Razor-encoded `data-itemname` read as a string arg. Verified a payload name no longer executes. | Areas/Admin/Views/Products/Index.cshtml, Stores/Index.cshtml, Stores/Edit.cshtml |
| FX-32 | **Anonymous order PII leak (OP-44)** — `Checkout/Confirmation?orderNumber=` returned any order's name/address/phone to unauthenticated visitors. Now requires the signed-in owner **or** a Data-Protection-signed token (issued on the post-payment redirect). Verified: anon no/bogus token → 404; owner → 200. | Controllers/CheckoutController.cs |
| FX-33 | **CSP header (OP-10)** — added a Content-Security-Policy (default-src 'self', external scripts/framing/base/form blocked; Google Fonts + https images allowed). Verified: no CSP violations on home/detail; inline handlers still run. ('unsafe-inline' remains until inline scripts move to nonces — see OP-45.) | Program.cs |
| FX-34 | **Staff session lifetime (H9)** — staff/admin now get an 8-hour, non-persistent auth cookie (overrides "remember me"); shoppers keep the 30-day sliding cookie. Verified: staff+RememberMe → session cookie. | Program.cs |
| FX-37 | **Variant-level stock — Phase 2 (OP-4)**: storefront product-detail per-variant availability + add-to-bag block for out-of-stock variant; cart `CombinedAvailableAsync` per-variant; **online reservation + fulfilment keyed by (store, product, variant)** via a shared effective-row resolver (variant row if stocked, else pool) so shared pools can't oversell. Verified e2e: a DevConfirm order for a stocked variant deducted the variant row (5→4), ledger Sale tagged the variant; detail availability 12/0 (stocked/fallback-to-zeroed-pool). | Services/OrderFulfilmentService.cs, Controllers/CartController.cs + ProductsController.cs, Models/ViewModels/ProductDetailViewModel.cs, Views/Products/Detail.cshtml |
| FX-36 | **Variant-level stock — Phase 1 (OP-4)**: `StoreInventory`/`StockReservation` gain nullable `ProductVariantId` (partial unique indexes); `StockService` resolves the variant row with a pool **fallback** (+`materializeVariant` for explicit per-variant sets, +`GetAvailableAsync`); Inventory Stock grid shows editable **per-variant rows**; POS checkout checks stock per variant. Online fulfilment/transfers pool-scoped (Phase 2). Verified: setting a variant's stock creates a distinct row, pool untouched. | Models/Domain/StoreInventory.cs + StockReservation.cs, Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs (+migration VariantLevelStock), Services/StockService.cs + OrderFulfilmentService.cs + TransferWorkflowService.cs, Areas/Inventory/Controllers/{Stock,Stocktake,Reports}Controller.cs + Views/Stock/Index.cshtml, Controllers/TillController.cs, Areas/Admin/{Controllers/InventoryController.cs,ViewModels/AdminViewModels.cs} |
| FX-35 | **Store-level authorization (OP-8 / H7)** — new `UserStore` join table + `IStoreAccessService` (Admin→all; assigned→those; none→all/legacy). Writes-only enforcement on stock edits, stock-take, transfers (approve/dispatch=from, receive=to, etc.) and till (open/checkout). Admin UI to assign branches per user (Users → Branches). Verified live: non-assigned branch edit blocked, assigned allowed, admin bypass. | Models/Domain/UserStore.cs, Services/StoreAccessService.cs, Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs (+migration), Areas/Inventory/Controllers/{Stock,Stocktake,Transfers}Controller.cs, Controllers/TillController.cs, Areas/Admin/Controllers/UsersController.cs, Areas/Admin/Views/Users/Stores.cshtml + Index.cshtml |
| FX-20 | Typed stock movements — adjustment reasons map to `Purchase`/`Damage`/`Loss` (was all `Adjustment`) | Models/Domain/StockMovement.cs, Areas/Inventory/Controllers/StockController.cs |
| FX-21 | Concurrency safety on manual adjustments + stock-take (lock + re-read + graceful catch) | Areas/Inventory/Controllers/StockController.cs, StocktakeController.cs |

## 🔲 Open — work these top-to-bottom

### 🔴 Critical
| ID | Item | Ref | Notes / approach |
|----|------|-----|------------------|
| OP-1 | Paystack **test** keys exposed in **git history** (commits before `4be47d9` "stop tracking dev secrets file"). Source is already clean: base `appsettings.json` = `YOUR_…` placeholders; dev file gitignored/untracked. **Remaining = USER ACTION:** rotate the test keys in the Paystack dashboard (history scrub then unnecessary since test-only). No code change. | C1 | ⚠️ user-only |
| ~~OP-2~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-41) — `FulfilmentRetryService` (BackgroundService, every 5 min + on startup) retries paid-but-unfulfilled **online** orders (idempotent FulfilPaidOrderAsync → self-heals transient failures) and emails the admin once for any stuck past 15 min (`Order.FulfilmentAlertedAt` dedupe); failures now stamp AdminNotes. Added a `Channel == Online` guard in both the query and FulfilPaidOrderAsync so POS sales are never re-fulfilled. Verified: a stuck online order auto-fulfilled on the next sweep; POS orders untouched; no double-deduction. | R2 / #12 | — |
| ~~OP-3~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-22) — `StoreInventoryConcurrencyToken` `Up()`/`Down()` neutralized to no-ops; both pending migrations applied to dev & verified (xmin still a system column, 12 CHECKs + indexes live) | D1 | — |

### 🟠 High
| ID | Item | Ref | Notes / approach |
|----|------|-----|------------------|
| ~~OP-44~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-32) — anonymous order-confirmation PII leak closed via Data-Protection-signed token (owner-or-token) | security audit | — |
| ~~OP-4~~ | ✅ **DONE** — Phase 1 (FX-36) per-variant balances/grid/POS + Phase 2 (FX-37) storefront availability, cart guard, **online reservation/fulfilment per variant**. (Per-variant stock-take *UI* still pool-level — minor, OP-48.) | R1 | — |
| ~~OP-5~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-45) — POS `Checkout` now sells against **available** (`GetAvailableAsync` = on-hand − reserved) in both the pre-check and the in-lock re-check, so the till can no longer sell units held for a pending online order. Till product search also shows `AvailableQuantity` so the cashier's number matches what's sellable. Verified (Playwright + DB) with on-hand 5 / reserved 3 (available 2): sell qty 3 → rejected "Not enough available stock"; qty 2 → sold (on-hand 5→3, reserved untouched, Sale ledger −2); qty 1 → rejected (available now 0). Test order/stock cleaned up. | #11 / I1 | — |
| ~~OP-6~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-43) — Paystack webhook now resolves the order by **exact** `metadata.order_number` (stamped at initiation) with a fallback to exact `PaymentReference == reference`; the loose `reference.Contains(OrderNumber)` substring match is gone. Also added an **amount-verification guard**: if the paid amount is below the order total, the order is flagged in AdminNotes and **not** auto-fulfilled (acks 200 so Paystack stops retrying). Verified with signed payloads: underpaid → flagged, not paid; substring-only reference with non-matching metadata → no match (old bug closed); bad signature → 401; exact metadata + correct amount → marked paid. | R3 | — |
| ~~OP-7~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-60) — changed three FKs from CASCADE→RESTRICT (migration `ProtectHistoryFkRestrict`): `OrderItems.ProductId`, `StockMovements.ProductId`, `Orders.UserId`. Deleting a product/user that has order or stock history is now blocked at the DB, so history/ledger can't be wiped. Admin product delete (single + bulk) pre-checks for history and returns a friendly "deactivate instead" message (with a `DbUpdateException` backstop); bulk delete deletes only history-free products and reports the rest. Verified: raw DELETE of product 2590 + a user-with-orders both rejected by RESTRICT; admin delete of 2590 → 200 + product intact, no 500. (`RefundItem` keeps a product *snapshot* with no FK, so refund history is unaffected.) | D2 | — |
| ~~OP-8~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-35) — store-level (writes-only) authorization: per-user branch assignment + enforcement on stock/stock-take/transfers/till; admin assignment UI | H7 | — |
| ~~OP-9~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-42) — `_ValidationScriptsPartial` referenced non-existent `wwwroot/lib/jquery-validation*` (404 + MIME errors) and the CDN fallback can't load under our `script-src 'self'` CSP; jQuery isn't loaded site-wide either, so client validation never actually ran. Made the partial a no-op with a comment — these auth forms are fully validated server-side (ModelState). Verified: Login page emits **no** jquery script refs. Follow-up: vendor jquery+validation+unobtrusive locally to satisfy CSP if client-side validation is wanted. | R11 | — |
| ~~OP-33~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-64) — back-in-stock requests are now persisted (`BackInStockRequests` table, migration `BackInStockRequests`) and emailed when the item returns. `NotifyRestock` saves the request (deduped: one pending row per product+email). `BackInStockNotifier` (BackgroundService, 10-min sweep + startup, mirrors `LowStockAlertService`) emails each requester once a product's combined available stock across active branches is > 0, stamping `NotifiedAt` **only on a successful send** (so requests survive an unconfigured SMTP and retry). Implemented as a sweep rather than a hook inside `StockService.ApplyAsync` — cleaner (no email in the stock transaction; one place handles every restock path: grid, transfer-receive, refund-return). Verified: request persisted + deduped; still-OOS product → no notify; after restock the sweep emailed the requester ("Back in stock: King Pearl Bracelet"); SMTP-off left it pending for retry. | merch audit | — | |
| ~~OP-28~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-44) — built an online-order refund workflow in Admin → Order detail (full or partial, item-level), mirroring the POS return: creates a `Refund`+`RefundItems`, optionally returns stock to the fulfilling store via the `Return` ledger (FOR UPDATE + xmin), and attempts a gateway refund (new `IPaymentService.RefundPaymentAsync`; Paystack real `/refund`, Stripe/Flutterwave report "not automated"). Best-effort gateway: the refund record + restock are authoritative, gateway failures are flagged in AdminNotes for a manual refund. Full refund → status `Refunded`; partial leaves status. Closed the cosmetic hole: `UpdateStatus` now **rejects** setting `Refunded` (removed from the dropdown + server-side guard). Verified end-to-end (Playwright + DB): partial refund restocked 10→11 with a Return ledger row, status stayed Delivered; full refund → Refunded + form hidden; gateway "Transaction not found" handled gracefully; direct `UpdateStatus=Refunded` POST left status unchanged. | admin audit | — |
| ~~OP-31~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-48 + FX-61) — FX-48 lets a guest Register with their email to upgrade the shell and see all their orders. FX-61 adds a no-account **`/track`** lookup: enter order number + the order email → see status, fulfilment, tracking #, items, total. Gated by both fields, rate-limited (`auth` policy), single generic "not found" message (no enumeration). Linked from the footer + the order confirmation page. Verified: correct number+email shows the order; wrong email / wrong number → "not found" with no order-number leak. | storefront audit | — |

### 🟡 Medium
| ID | Item | Ref | Notes |
|----|------|-----|-------|
| ~~OP-10~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-33) — CSP header added (pragmatic, `'unsafe-inline'` for now) | R7 | — |
| ~~OP-45~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-68, storefront-scoped) — per-request CSP **nonce** (hex; middleware sets `script-src 'self' 'nonce-…'` with **no `'unsafe-inline'`** on the public storefront; `/Admin`, `/Inventory`, `/Till` keep `'unsafe-inline'` as they're authenticated + still use inline handlers). Refactored every storefront inline handler to `addEventListener` (nav search links, listing sort `data-autosubmit`, profile edit toggle → app.js; checkout fulfilment/state/LGA/redeem + JS-built delivery options; product-detail thumbnails + variant selects → in-script wiring) and nonced the inline `<script>`/JSON-LD blocks. `style-src` keeps `'unsafe-inline'` (inline styles pervasive + low-risk). Verified (Playwright console): **0 CSP violations** across home, nav search, listing+sort, detail (thumb+variant), cart qty, checkout (fulfilment+delivery), profile edit; header nonce matches the body byte-for-byte; admin/Till still permissive. | follow-up to FX-33 | storefront only (admin/till deliberately permissive) |
| ~~OP-11~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-48) — added `ApplicationUser.IsGuest` (migration `UserIsGuest`). Guest checkout now: **(1)** never attaches an order to a real registered account — if the email belongs to a non-guest account it blocks with "an account exists, please sign in/reset password" (was: silently attached → cross-person history); **(2)** reuses the existing guest shell for the same email instead of creating a new one each time (no sprawl); **(3)** on Register with a guest email, **upgrades** the shell into a full account (sets the password, `IsGuest=false`) so they keep their guest orders (the "merge"). Verified (Playwright + DB): new guest → 1 shell (IsGuest=true); repeat guest → same shell reused (2 orders, 1 user); registered email → blocked; register with guest email → upgraded + signed in + both prior orders visible. Test data cleaned up. | R4 | — |
| ~~OP-12~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-71) — Production no longer silently auto-migrates on startup. `Program.cs` now checks `GetPendingMigrationsAsync()`: **0 pending →** logs "schema is up to date" + boots; **pending + `Database:AutoMigrate=false` (the default) →** throws on startup with the list of pending migrations + guidance ("apply as a deploy step: `dotnet ef database update` / migration bundle"), so a bad/unexpected migration can't take the site down and concurrent instances can't race. Escape hatch: `Database:AutoMigrate=true` restores startup migration. Documented in `appsettings.json`. Dev path (`EnsureCreatedAsync`) unchanged. Verified (Production env, isolated DB): empty DB → fail-fast listing 23 pending (never started listening); `AutoMigrate=true` → applied all 23 + homepage 200; up-to-date DB + default → "schema is up to date" + 0 applied + 200; Dev → boots 200. | R5 | Run migrations as a gated deploy step. |
| OP-13 | Only Paystack has a webhook; Stripe/Flutterwave rely on browser callback only | R6 | Add webhooks if those providers go live. |
| OP-14 | Dev `EnsureCreated` vs Prod `Migrate` — migrations never exercised in dev | R8 | Use migrations in dev too. |
| OP-15 | Stock ledger sparse — opening balances imported w/o `StockMovement` rows (can't reconstruct stock) | D3 / #15 | Write opening-stock `Adjustment` movements on import. |
| OP-16 | No dedicated Purchase/PO module (stock receipt is a typed adjustment) + no shrinkage report | I3 | Build POs; report grouping new `Damage`/`Loss` types. |
| ~~OP-17~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-47) — pushed report aggregation to SQL instead of loading the whole catalogue/inventory into memory: Inventory **Reorder** (per-product totals + threshold filter in DB; per-store breakdown fetched only for products at/below threshold) + **Value** (per-branch and per-product units/value via grouped SQL); Admin **Stock** (totals/by-branch/low-stock all grouped in SQL) + **Sales** (count/gross/by-payment/by-day/by-branch grouped in SQL). Admin **Products** was already SQL-aggregated. Verified (Playwright + DB): all six pages 200 with totals matching direct SQL (Stock ₦297,300/45u/2974 oos; Sales gross ₦980,350/refunds ₦20,900/14 orders; Reorder 991). Note: ordering by a *record* property after GroupBy doesn't translate — projected to anon types then mapped/ordered in memory. Residual low-impact items (bulk/stocktake per-line writes, customers N+1, audit-export cap) left as minor follow-ups. | H10–H14 | minor residuals only |
| ~~OP-18~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-46) — **(a)** Explicit stronger password policy: length 8 + upper + lower + digit + 4 unique chars (was: no uppercase requirement). **(b)** Email-confirmation flow built: Register generates a token + sends a confirm link (link also logged in Development since SMTP is off), `ConfirmEmail` verifies it, `ResendConfirmation` + an unconfirmed-email banner on Profile. Enforcement (`RequireConfirmedEmail`) is deliberately left **off** — flipping it on would lock out the 3 existing unconfirmed users and depends on live SMTP; enabling it is a one-line flip once existing users are grandfathered (`EmailConfirmed=true`) and SMTP is configured (documented in Program.cs). Verified (Playwright + DB): weak pw rejected ("must have an uppercase"); strong pw registers + shows banner + EmailConfirmed=false; confirm link → EmailConfirmed=true + banner clears; invalid/missing token redirect cleanly. | H8, H9 | enforce-confirmation is the remaining opt-in step (user decision). |
| OP-19 | Thin automated test coverage (no POS/transfer/discount/payment/authz tests) | R9 | Add integration tests. |
| OP-27 | No admin view for **Reservations** (stock holds on unpaid orders) — active holds are invisible, so "out of stock" caused by holds can't be diagnosed | admin audit | Read-only holds list (order, product, branch, qty, age). |

### 🟢 Low
| ID | Item | Ref | Notes |
|----|------|-----|-------|
| OP-20 | Refund skips restock when `storeId==0` (practically unreachable) | I4 | Fall back to register store / validate. |
| OP-21 | Refunds & POS sales not in `AuditLog` (have own records) | I5 | Optional, for uniform audit. |
| OP-22 | Audit log doesn't capture old/new values | H15 | Add before/after snapshot. |
| OP-23 | `ParkedSale` stored as opaque, unversioned `CartJson` | R12 | Versioned schema. |
| OP-24 | Session/cache default in-memory (no horizontal scale unless Redis set) | R13 | Configure Redis for prod. |
| ~~OP-42~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-49) — addressed via **data-caching** rather than full-page OutputCache: full-page caching is unsafe here because every storefront page embeds a per-request antiforgery token and a per-session nav (cart badge / wishlist / auth state), which would be shared across users. Instead cached the genuinely expensive, non-personalized query — `MerchandisingService.BestSellersAsync` (a GROUP BY over the whole OrderItems ledger, called **twice per home load** for all-time + trending) and `NewArrivalsAsync` — in `IMemoryCache` with a 5-min TTL. HTML still renders per-request so nav/tokens stay correct. Verified: across 5 home loads the best-seller GROUP BY ran only **twice** (once per cache key) instead of 10×. Trade-off: best-sellers can be up to 5 min stale (fine for a merch row). Full-page OutputCache deferred (would need a client-side cart badge + token handling); featured/category queries are cheap indexed lookups left as-is. | perf audit | full-page OutputCache deferred |
| ~~OP-43~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-50, code side) — `UseStaticFiles` now sets `Cache-Control` via `OnPrepareResponse`: content-addressed assets get `public,max-age=31536000,immutable` — css/js carry a `?v=<hash>` (asp-append-version) and everything under `/uploads` is saved with a unique `{Guid:N}` filename (a replacement is always a new URL); other/unversioned assets (favicon) get `max-age=86400`. ETag/Last-Modified preserved (conditional GET still 304s). This makes the app CDN-ready. Verified: css `?v=` + `/uploads/*` → immutable 1yr; bare css/favicon → 1 day; `If-None-Match` → 304. **Remaining (infra, not code):** actually front `/uploads` + static with a CDN in production. | perf audit / CDN readiness | CDN provisioning is an ops task |
| ~~OP-25~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-42) — renamed the action `Request` → `RequestTransfer` and kept the public route via `[ActionName("Request")]`, so it no longer hides `ControllerBase.Request` (CS0108 gone — **build is now 0 warnings**). Verified: `POST /Inventory/Transfers/Request` still resolves (302 → login, not 404). | — | — |
| OP-26 | Storefront: no reviews/ratings, no abandoned-cart recovery, product images lack width/height (CLS) | H16–H18 | Conversion/SEO backlog. |
| ~~OP-29~~ | ✅ **DONE** (already) — re-checked during the FX-42 batch: `OrdersController.ExportCsv` already calls `LogAsync("Export", "Order", null, …)` before returning the file. No change needed. | admin audit | — |
| OP-41 | `wwwroot/js/app.js` (8 KB) ships unminified | perf audit | Minify in the build/asset pipeline. |
| ~~OP-46~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-40) — made the Postgres-isms provider-conditional: the `xmin` rowversion mapping and all 6 `FOR UPDATE` lock sites are guarded by `Database.IsNpgsql()` (active in prod, no-op on the SQLite test harness). All **13 tests pass**; Postgres lock/concurrency behaviour unchanged. | variant Phase 2 | — |
| ~~OP-47~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-38) — `CheckoutViewModel : IValidatableObject` requires the address only for Delivery, store only for Pickup; removed unconditional `[Required]`. Verified: a pickup order placed with no address → created + fulfilled. | variant Phase 2 | — |
| ~~OP-48~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-39) — stock-take sheet now has per-variant rows; variance keyed by product+variant; Apply materializes the variant row. Verified: counting a variant → variant row created. | variant Phase 2 | — |
| ~~OP-30~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-42) — fixed the mojibake at the **source** (`Infrastructure/SeedData.cs`, 3 stores) and in the **live DB** (`UPDATE "Stores" SET "OpeningHours"='Mon-Sat: 8am-8pm, Sun: 12pm-8pm'`, 3 rows). Used ASCII hyphens to avoid re-encoding. Verified: Stores page now renders `Mon-Sat: 8am-8pm, Sun: 12pm-8pm`. | storefront audit | — |
| OP-32 | Product detail "Reviews (0)" tab is a dead end — always "no reviews", no way to submit (no reviews feature) | storefront audit / H16 | Build reviews, or hide the tab until shipped. |
| OP-38 | Product JSON-LD lacks `priceValidUntil` / `shippingDetails` / `hasMerchantReturnPolicy` (Google Merchant rich-result enrichments) | SEO audit | Add to Detail.cshtml product schema. |
| OP-39 | BreadcrumbList JSON-LD only on product detail, not on category/listing pages | SEO audit | Add breadcrumb schema to Products/Index. |
| OP-40 | No `aggregateRating`/`review` schema (blocked on reviews feature) — do **not** fake it | SEO audit / OP-32 | Add once reviews ship. |
| ~~OP-34~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-51) — `MerchandisingService.FrequentlyBoughtTogetherAsync(productId, take)`: co-purchase analysis (orders containing the product → other products in those orders ranked by how many of those orders they share), `IMemoryCache` 5-min TTL. Shown as a "Frequently Bought Together" row on the product detail page (above Related), hidden when there are no co-purchases. Verified (seeded a 2-product order + DB/HTTP): band-ring ↔ pendant cross-show correctly; a product with no co-purchase shows no section. Test order cleaned up. | merch audit | — |
| ~~OP-35~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-52) — added `CartViewModel.SavedItems` (in the session cart) + `SaveForLater` / `MoveToBag` / `RemoveSaved` actions. Cart page shows a "Save for later" link per line and a "Saved for later" section (Move to bag / Remove); saved items don't count toward totals or checkout, and the bag-empty message only shows when both lists are empty. `MoveToBag` re-checks live availability. Verified (Playwright): Add → Save (item leaves bag, enters Saved) → Move to bag (returns) → Save + Remove (both empty). | merch audit | — |
| ~~OP-36~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-66) — `AbandonedCart` snapshot (table; one row per email) captured in `PlaceOrder` when a shopper reaches checkout; `AbandonedCartService` (BackgroundService, 30-min sweep) emails a recovery link after `notifications.abandoned_cart_hours` (default 4) if not paid — skips snapshots that since converted to a paid order, sends once (`EmailedAt`). Recovery link `/cart/recover?token=` rebuilds the bag (re-validating price/availability) and marks `RecoveredAt`. Settings `notifications.abandoned_cart` + `_hours`. Designed around the 30-min unpaid-order auto-cancel: the snapshot is independent of the order, so the hours-later email still has the items. Verified end-to-end (Playwright + DB + pickup folder): checkout captured a 2-item/₦12k snapshot; after backdating past the threshold the sweep sent exactly one "You left something in your bag" email; the recovery link restored the bag and set RecoveredAt. | merch audit / H17 | — |
| ~~OP-37~~ | ✅ **DONE** (FX-53, foundation) — `LoyaltyAccount` + `PointsLedgerEntry` tables (migration `LoyaltyFoundation`); `ILoyaltyService.AccrueForOrderAsync` awards **1 pt per ₦100** on a paid order, **idempotent** (existence check + unique index on `OrderId`). Hooked into every paid-order path: online callback, **webhook**, dev-confirm, and POS till (credits the attached customer; walk-ins earn nothing). Balance shown on the account Profile page. Verified (signed webhook + DB + Playwright): a ₦10,000 order awarded exactly 100 pts, **two webhooks → still 100** (idempotent), profile shows "100"; stock fulfilled correctly. **Admin controls (FX-54):** added `loyalty.enabled` (on/off) + `loyalty.naira_per_point` (rate) to Admin → Settings → Loyalty; the service reads them live (verified: rate 50 → 200 pts; disabled → 0 pts); profile reflects the configured rate and hides when off. Test data cleaned up. **Redemption (FX-59):** ✅ customers can now redeem points at checkout — settings `loyalty.point_value` (₦/point) + `loyalty.redemption_enabled`; checkout shows an "Use N points (₦M off)" option (signed-in only, capped at points held & order value, ≥₦1 left to charge); points are **earmarked** at placement (reduces the charged amount) and **deducted on payment** (idempotent via `Order.LoyaltyRedeemedAt`), so abandoned orders never lose points. Redemption + total shown on confirmation + admin order detail. Verified end-to-end (Playwright + webhook + DB): 500 pts → ₦500 off a ₦6k order; on payment balance went 500→95 (−500 redeem +95 earn on the net ₦9.5k); two webhooks stayed idempotent. | merch audit | — |
